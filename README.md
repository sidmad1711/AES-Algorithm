# AES-Encryption-Algorithm
One of the strongest Cryptosystems

Advanced Encryption standard uses the Rijndael cipher which is basically a Symmetric key Block Cipher.
This consistes of 4 functions mainly AddRoundKey, SubBytes, ShiftRows and MixColumns.
AES uses 128, 192 as well as 256 bits keys.
128 bits key has 10 rounds.
192 bits key has 12 rounds.
256 bits key has 14 rounds.

aes.c - contains the option of 128, 192 and 256 bits keys with a predifined plain text.
